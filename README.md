# Coffee-Reminder
Have you ever grabbed a coffee before work, set it down for it to cool, 
and then forget about it until its too late and too cold?
This simple hack can help you out! 
By constantly reading and updating the temperature of your beverage, 
this cup holder reminds you when your drink reaches optimal enjoying temperature. 
Never have a drink too hot or too cold again!

This hack was created at PennApps using an Arduino kit. 
We kept things simple to allow us to learn and experience more from our first hackathon.
